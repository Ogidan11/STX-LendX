# STX-LendX Lending Pool Smart Contract (Stacks / Clarity)

A decentralized STX-based lending protocol implemented in Clarity, allowing users to:

* Deposit STX and earn interest
* Borrow STX against their deposits
* Be liquidated if undercollateralized
* Participate in flash loans
* Administer protocol parameters with governance-level access

---

## üìú Contract Overview

* **Collateralized lending**
* **Interest accrual**
* **Liquidation mechanics**
* **Flash loans**
* **Administrative controls**
* **Event logging for all key operations**

### Maps

* `user-deposits { user: principal } ‚Üí { amount, last-update }`
* `user-borrows { user: principal } ‚Üí { amount, last-update }`
* `whitelisted-liquidators { user: principal } ‚Üí { active: bool }`

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Core Functions

### Deposit

```clarity
(deposit (amount uint))
```

* Transfers `amount` of STX from user to contract.
* Updates deposit balance and emits a `deposit` event.

### Withdraw

```clarity
(withdraw (amount uint))
```

* Only possible if resulting collateral ratio remains above the required threshold.
* Transfers STX back to the user.

### Borrow

```clarity
(borrow (amount uint))
```

* Requires sufficient collateral ratio.
* Increases user‚Äôs borrow amount and transfers STX to them.

### Repay

```clarity
(repay (amount uint))
```

* Transfers STX from user to repay loan.
* Updates borrow balance and emits a `repay` event.

---

## üî• Liquidation

### Liquidate Underwater Accounts

```clarity
(liquidate (borrower principal) (amount uint))
```

* Anyone can liquidate an undercollateralized user.
* Repays `amount` of borrower‚Äôs debt and receives `amount + fee` worth of collateral.
* Emits `liquidation` event.

---

## üìà Interest Accrual

```clarity
(accrue-interest (user principal))
```

* Calculates interest based on `blocks-elapsed`.
* Adds interest to borrower‚Äôs debt.
* Emits `interest-accrued` event.

---

## ‚ö° Flash Loans

```clarity
(flash-loan (amount uint) (recipient principal) (memo optional(buff 34)))
```

* Transfers `amount` STX to `recipient`.
* Ensures `amount + fee (0.1%)` is returned in the same transaction.
* Adds fee to `total-deposits`.

## üí° Collateral and Liquidation Logic

* **Minimum Collateral Ratio**: Must be ‚â• 150% (default)
* **Liquidation Threshold**: If collateral ratio < 120%, liquidation is possible.
* **Liquidation Penalty**: Liquidator receives borrower collateral + 5% bonus.
* **Interest Accrual**: Compounds per block based on an annualized rate.

## üõ† Deployment Note

```clarity
(begin
  (try! (stx-transfer? u1000000000 CONTRACT_OWNER (as-contract tx-sender)))
  (ok true))
```

> This initialization block transfers an initial STX amount to the contract during deployment. Adjust as needed.
